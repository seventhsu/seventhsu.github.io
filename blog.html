							<h3"What's in a leader?"</h3>
							<p>9 Dec 2022, by Ali Albaghdadi</p>
						</header>
						<p>
							I posted recently about my aspirations of becoming a leader ever since childhood: a fire that burned within me and guided my career through all its trials and tribulations. But what truly does it mean to be a leader? How does one become a leader, and how does one stay a leader (or better, how does one become a well-liked leader)? Attending the Hoeft Technology and Management seminars here at UIUC may not have given me the complete answer book, but they have helped point me in the right direction to answer these questions.
						</p>
						<p>
							First, a leader is not a superior. It is impossible to be an effective and well-liked leader, especially within a closely knit setting like the workplace or the office, when trying to assert dominance over everyone and micromanage everything. Many prospective leaders often make this mistake by monitoring their subjects closely and enforcing their word as the final one in an attempt to show themselves as benefitting the group more than they really are. Not only does trying to do this burn you out by trying to do everyone’s jobs at the same time, your team may feel disgruntled if they think you think they don’t deserve privacy or autonomy. This kind of distrust can sink a team very quickly. A good leader separates themselves from a boss by needing little authority; they are a voice of reason and advice rather than force, and take a more hands-off approach to their team members’ progress towards whatever the shared goal of the team may be.

							Being a part of the Hoeft Technology and Management program, as short as this experience was, has helped connect me to so many new people I might otherwise have never gotten the chance to meet. The weekly meetings showed me new perspectives from new people, a critical asset and source of knowledge in the highly experience-dependent realm of being a leader. I am truly grateful for the opportunity that I’ve been given, and while I most likely will not pursue the Technology and Management minor in its entirety, the fire of responsibility and leadership still burns within me, and I am and forever will be determined to make my own difference in the world.

							<h3>When I Grow Up...</h3>
							<p>18 Nov 2022, by Ali Albaghdadi</p>
						</header>
						<p>I want to spread joy. I always knew it deep down. No matter how I do it, no matter many times the middle school cliques looked down on me or the district’s red tape beat me down, I was always determined to be heard. I was good at making myself heard, and when I was heard, I strived for it to be for something that made others happy. Sometimes that meant making a fool of myself. People laughed, but I never let it bother me. What I realize now, years down the line and looking over the brink towards the beginning of my real career, is that those were the fledgling actions of a leader wanting to break out. I loved a lot of cool things, and I wanted to show the world all of them, and I wanted the world to be happy.
						</p><p>
							Unfortunately, when the paths diverged in an academic sense and it came time for me to choose my career, I had to contend with a lot of pressure. Many, many people in many, many other disciplines might understand my feelings when my parents told me I should have instead gone into medical school and become a doctor “because it’s a respectable discipline” and “because they can take care of their parents when they get old.” But I didn’t feel like a doctor was a real leader. To say nothing of the fact that I was terrified of hospitals, the idea of only seeing one patient at a time rubbed me the wrong way. I wanted to have an audience, and I wanted the audience to see all my great ideas. My parents contented themselves with the idea of me becoming an engineer, and my journey towards being a leader began.
						</p><p>
							Cars were a huge interest for me growing up, and they really picked the career of engineering for me. I showed many people many things in the pursuit of spreading joy and interesting other people, but none more than cars: drawings of cars, made-up specs, everything. As I learned more and more about math, the sciences and history, all those little separate things about cars I picked up from books and the internet started to connect.
						</p><p>
							My official schooling was nothing particularly special, or even consistent: I was homeschooled for a number of years, and came back only to have high school ruined by the pandemic. Nothing I learned in school related to topics I liked thinking about, and in fact I, like many other dreamers in the slog of the American public school system, was punished frequently for pursuing what I wanted to learn about more. The idea of gaining experience leadership, or even any sense of extroversion, was similarly nullified by the bureaucracy. I had already known that engineering would get me closest to both of these things that I wanted to do, and the rest of the story was college applications, but it still hurts to think that so many children grow up with the world actively working against them as they try to be what they want to be and do the things they want to do.
						</p><p>
							My journey to where I am career-wise wasn’t the straightest, but there’s no other place I’d rather be. I know how much time I have ahead of me and the value of not only the position I’m in, but also what that position allows me to become. Where I stand academically in my university travails, everything from here on out will simply serve to refine my technical and leadership skills, and the opportunities those open up will let me accomplish even more. I can’t wait for what’s next.
